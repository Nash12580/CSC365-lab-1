Lab 1-A of CSC365.

- Program was written in Java, so you should be able to run program through the main file. 
- No command line input is needed since the path to the students.txt data is already coded into the program. 
- When running commands and arguments, although the format is to type a "command letter : [number/lastName]",
    our program is able to run without the spaces between the command, colon, and argument because of how the
    parsing of user input is handled.
- When inputing LASTNAME arguments, make sure that they are CAPTILALIZED, otherwise the query searches will return
    empty.
